<h1>Seth Trenton Stone</h1>
<body>
    <p id="intro">Hello, my name is Seth.  I am 37 years old, and I am currently working as a physical therapist
    assistant in Dallas, TX.  I've done some coding and programming since high school, and now
    I am looking to change my career and do it full-time.  I want to focus on front-end development first, and
    later transition to full-stack development.
    <br><br>
    This first website will be a general public profile of myself and overview
    of various projects.

    <h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
    
    <p id="bio">I recieved my formal education at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, ARK where
        I majored in Biology and minored in Chemistry.  I worked at my parent's automotive center
        post graduation from 2010-2011.  I then moved to Dallas, TX where I worked as a benefits verification
        specialist at Amerisoucre-Bergen.  I left in 2012 to return to ARK to follow up on potential opportunities.
        I designed, constructed, and maintained a private Bitcoin mining operation from 2013-2015, but was forced to liqudate
        my assets due to financial struggles due to soured business partnership involving exotic
        reptile trade and importation.  2016 I seeked another career change, and looked to physical
        therapy.  I decided to enroll in an accelerated program to obtain my PTA license and began
        working in home health in October 2017.  I have been at this position to the 
        time of this writing.
