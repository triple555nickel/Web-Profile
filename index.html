<h1>Seth Trenton Stone</h1>
<body>
    <p>Hello, my name is Seth.  I am 37 years old, and I am currently working as a physical therapist
    assistant.  I've played with coding and programming on and off since high school, and now
    I am looking to change my career.  I want to focus on front-end development first, and
    later transition to full-stack development.</p>

    <p>This first website will be a general public profile of myself
