<h1>Seth Trenton Stone</h1>
<body>
    <p>Hello, my name is Seth.  I am 37 years old, and I am currently working as a physical therapist
    assistant.  I've played with coding and programming on and off since high school, and now
    I am looking to change my career.  I want to focus on front-end development first, and
    later transition to full-stack development.</p>

    <p>This first website will be a general public profile of myself

    <p id="bio">I recieved my formal education at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, AR where
        I majored in Biology and minored in Chemistry.  I worked at my parent automotive center
        post graduation from 2010-2011.  I then moved to Dallas, TX where I worked as a benefits verification
        specialist at Amerisoucre-Bergen.  I left in 2012 to return to AR to follow up on potential opportunities.
        I worked on a personal Bitcoin mining operation from 2013-2015, but was forced to liqudate
        my assets due to financial struggles due to a failed business endeavor involving exotic
        animal trade and importation.  2016 I seeked another career change, and looked to physical
        therapy.  I decided to enroll in an accelerated program to obtain my PTA license and began
        working in home health in October 2017.  I have been at this position to the 
        time of this writing.
    </p>

    <p1>My intention is to move home to Arkansas to be closer to help family, and to settle
        down myself.  I wish to create a fruitful career in full-stack development, one that
        will provide a remote position, good work/life balance, and room for advancement.
